			<p  class="animal-important-info"><strong>Sloths</strong> have a four-part stomach that very slowly digests the tough leaves they eat, it can sometimes take up to a month for them to digest a meal. Digesting this diet means a sloth has very little energy left to move around making it one of the slowest moving animals in the world.</p>

			<p>No creature in the animal kingdom is as chill as the tree-dwelling sloth. They spend their days hanging from branches, munching on leaves, sleeping and even going for the occasional swim. What's not to love?</p>
